MiT FSD Course, Section 1 (JS, CSS, Bootstrap, HTML) -- Exercises: eye, pac-man, map
The code for this exercise was created by faculty for MiT xPro's Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development with MERN course (August 2022 cohort). I used Bootstrap for the navigation on the first two pages and modified it.

###Project Description
Portfolio 1

###How to Locally Run Portfolio 1
From this Portfolio 1 repository, download the following files:
cjfrance.html
eyes.js
styles.css
Next, open cjfrance.html in a browser window.

###Future Improvements
I have some redesign ideas for this project.
* I hard coded the elements with absolute positioning. However, I will adjust the code to make it responsive, so it appears correctly on any screen, instead of only lining up on my MacBook Pro.
