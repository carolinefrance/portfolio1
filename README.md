[Navbar text with an inline element](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/components/navbar/)
* I modified the .navbar-light default CSS by changing the font size, color, background color, and link styles (highlighted hover)
* The navbar is used on cjfrance.html and projects.html

[Cards](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/components/card/)

### Project Description
###### Portfolio 1 is an front-end web development assignment for MiT's FSD Course, Section 1 (JS, CSS, Bootstrap, HTML). The source code for the three exercises (linked on projects.html) was provided by the MiT course designers. However, I modified some of the CSS on these pages.
###### I created the files in this repository using JS, CSS, Bootstrap, HTML.

### How to Locally Run Portfolio 1
###### From this Portfolio 1 repository, download the following files:
* cjfrance.html
* contact.html
* projects.html
* CSS/style-contact.css
* CSS/style-grid-landing.css
* CSS/style-newBSnav.css
* CSS/style-recycle.css
** The style-recycle.css styles are used on multiple pages.

* IMG/icon-github-green.png
* IMG/icon-linkedin-green.png
* IMG/PacMen-Exercise.png
* IMG/Real-Time-Bus-Tracker.png

###### Next, once the files are downloaded, open cjfrance.html in a browser window.

### Future Improvements
###### I have some redesign ideas for this project.
* I hard coded some elements with absolute positioning. However, I will adjust the code to make it responsive, so it appears correctly on any screen, instead of only lining up on my MacBook Pro.
