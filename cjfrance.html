    <p><strong>Hi, I'm Caroline J. France, and I work in languages, learning, and technology.</strong><br>
<br>
<strong>Colorado</strong> (1997), I graduated from the University of Nothern Colorado with a B.A. in Musical Theatre.<br>
<br>
<strong>New York City</strong> (1998-2005), I landed work in editorial and IT. I proofread stacks of presentations at fast-paced investment banks. For a start-up market research firm, I wrote and edited copy. After teaching myself computer skills on the subway, and I soon became their front-end developer, where I used CSS, PhotoShop, and Flash. Later, they let me write simple code as a junior Java developer. I ran SQL queries and conducted multi-tiered software testing. During this time, I was NY and nationally certified as an EMT and was appointed the company's fire marshall.<br>
<br>
<strong>Shanghai, China</strong> (2006-2012), I worked with languages. While I was studying Chinese at university, I taught English at three schools (K-12 and adults). I created a website for students, with games, links, and digital flashcards; the school used the resources I developed several years after I departed. Also, I taught Microsoft Office (Excel macros and object linking and embedding) at a consultancy company in China. I translated their corporate intelligence reports from Chinese, Spanish, and French into English.<br>
<br>
<strong>Greenville, SC</strong> (2012-2015), I returned to college. I co-founded the Biology club, was elected president of my college's honor society and regional vice president of South Carolina. I managed numerous volunteer activities, organized and ran conferences, and collaborated on research projects that benefited the college and community. For example, I collaborated with SCDHEC, spoke in front of Greenville County Council, and led a publicized flash mob to raise awareness of high radon levels in the area. In competition with 1,300 other colleges worldwide, Phi Theta Kappa International recognized our college's honor society for our distinctive projects and leadership. During this time, an essay and short story of mine were published in the <em>Nota Bene</em> literary anthology, and I was a winner of a Michelin essay competition. I received the President's Award (similar to valedictorian, 4.0 GPA) at graduation, and was awarded several academic and service scholarships.<br>
<br>
<strong>Furman University</strong> (2016-2019), I studied English and computer science. I received the Rudolf Bates award for excellence in literary analysis of Victorian literature. Also, I spent a summer as a computer science research fellow; I created 3-D models in Blender based on museum photographs. I spoke at three research conferences and graduated magna cum laude with a B.A. in English. Also, I completed an online Teaching in Higher Education Certification through <strong>Harvard University</strong>.<br>
<br>
<strong>Greenville Technical College</strong> (2019-present), I continue to tutor and teach college English. Currently, I tutor computer science, psychology, philosophy, biology, art, music, and writing. I get to serve people of all ages, nationalities, and abilities. When I'm not tutoring, I'm building my computer skills because the traditional model of teaching needs a redesign. Visually stunning, gamified, and personalized educational software is needed to keep today's students engaged.<br>
<br>
<strong>MiT's Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development</strong> program is my first step on my software engineering journey. Then, I plan to learn more about game design, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and natural language processing. I have many ideas on how to apply my expertise and intuition to future programs. Ultimately, I hope to integrate my skills in storytelling, interpersonal communication, languages, design, and technology to solve problems.
