#PacMen-Exercise
The code for this exercise was created by faculty for MiT xPro's Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development with MERN course (August 2022 cohort). I made minor modifications to styles in the header.

###Project Description
This front-end exercise is from the course's Module 7: Introduction to GitHub, Testing, and the DOM. Viewers will open an html web page that has two buttons (1) Add Pacman and (2) Start Game. JavaScript array methods are used to generate a PacMan image when the Add Pacman button is clicked. The Start Game button calls a function that moves the new image (which alternates with a second image facing the same direction) and sets a random velocity. I only changed the CSS to add padding, place the buttons, and add a radial gradient to the background.

###How to Locally Run the PacMen-Exercise
From this PacMen-Exercise repository, download the following files:
index.html
pacmen.js
images/PacMan1.png
images/PacMan2.png
images/PacMan3.png
images/PacMan4.png
Next, open index.html in a browser window.

###Future Improvements
I have some redesign ideas for this project.
* I plan to combine code from this exercise with the initial Pac-Man exercise.
* Next, I plan to follow a YouTube tutorial on how to create an actual Pac-Man game. Specifically, Coding with Adam has a three-hour video called ["Coding Pac-Man in JavaScript Complete Tutorial Every Step Explained"] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk48dQCdQ3E) that I have watched and would like to modify.
* I plan to change Pac-Man into a shark in PhotoShop, add fangs, fins, and scales that shift from image 1 to image 2, to make it look like he is swimming. Also, I would like to add in other characters and redesign it with an environmental storyline.
