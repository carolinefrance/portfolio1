#Real-Time-Bus-Tracker
The code for this exercise was created by faculty for MiT xPro's Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development with MERN course (August 2022 cohort). I modified the style of the map.

###Project Description
This front-end exercise is from Module 9: Asynchronous Code. The MiT source code provides a bus tracker that is a JavaScript program. This bus tracker renders a customizable map from Mapbox.com on a webpage that can be manipulated. The asynchronous JavaScript moves the marker on the map from bus stop to bus stop, from MiT to Harvard University, based on an array of coordinates. I modified the map on [Studio.Mapbox.com] (https://studio.mapbox.com/styles/cjfrance/clahrbsq1000014qp2fqtdjv9/edit/#16/42.358962/-71.096349) by changing from the original code, version 1, to the more recent version 3. This enabled me to change the style to a satellite view.

###How to Locally Run the Real-Time-Bus-Tracker
From this Real-Time-Bus-Tracker repository, download the following files:
index.html
mapanimation.js
styles.css
Next, open index.html in a browser window.

###Future Improvements
I have some redesign ideas for this project.
* I updated the code from the deprecated version 1 to the more recent version 3. This enabled me to use different styles for the background and markers. However, it destroyed the functionality that worked in version 1. My first priority is to look at the version 3 documentation to get the tracker to work. I posted a screenshot of the map with the modified style, but I uploaded the map with the working JavaScript code.
* I have some ideas on creating my own maps that are relevant to my current city. The majority of bus riders in my city are low-income or homeless, so I would like to create a map that pinpoints stops near social services, such as homeless shelters, low-income health clinics, mental health clinics, religious charitable services, public libraries, and other services that would be useful to this community.
